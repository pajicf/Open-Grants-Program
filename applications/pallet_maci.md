# Open Grant Proposal

## Project Overview ðŸ“„

This application is a response to [On-chain Quadratic Funding RfP](https://github.com/w3f/General-Grants-Program/blob/master/rfp-proposal/on-chain-quadratic-funding.md)

## Overview

Please provide the following:

* A brief description of the project.

There are numerous crowdfunding platforms dedicated to boosting the development and growth of different blockchains and their communities. One of the most famous ones is Gitcoin.co, which has had a significant influence on the Ethereum ecosystem's development.

Some of them are based on the quadratic funding mechanism, which became one of the fairest and most efficient ways to allocate funds to a sufficient number of projects that contribute to the ecosystem. 

However, a similar solution hasn't been developed for the substrate-based blockchains. Thus, we want to create one. Moreover, we want to create a package that will include quadratic funding, user registry, and maci pallets and in addition to that first substrate-based crowdfunding platform. Thereby we will offer a finished solution that anyone can use to collect and allocate funds among different projects within their ecosystems.

This proposal is the first step as we primarily want to create a "MACI" (Minimal Anti Collusion Infrastructure) pallet that will help us to prevent collusion. Once we are finished with this pallet, we will move to the next step that will be pallet-user-registry.

More information about our long term plan you can find in the [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ogj8S1NpsdqgGKP9dF4rinQEgfk3BH5IoOVKvFaPOjM/edit#heading=h.dydg2sazp5h8).

* An indication of how you will integrate this project into Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama.

This is a regular pallet that can be merged into any substrate-based blockchain.
In the long run, once we develop the crowdfunding platform,  we aim to integrate this solution into Kusama and potentially Polkadot, so a portion of treasury funds can be allocated to the projects chosen by the community through this platform. 

* An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.

We have been developing numerous products on the other blockchain infrastructures such as Ethereum and Stellar. Starting from last year, we decided to focus our time and efforts more on the substrate ecosystem. Hence, we became a member of the Substrate Delivery Partners program, and a few of our team members became Polkadot ambassadors. Also, we hosted an online Substrate event - [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJLUO7s-n3M&t=2s)

Recently we finished another web3 grant that we had been working on - Substrate Blockchain Starter Kit - [link](https://substrate-starterkit.mvpworkshop.co/#/).

This year, we aim to dedicate even more time to substrate-based projects, especially those that can benefit the community. Thatâ€™s why we got interested in creating the first substrate crowdfunding platform. 

Also, we find it interesting to work on the solution (pallet) that will prevent collusion.
 
# Project details

### Technology Stack
`pallet-maci`  
**Preventing collusion:**

There are various problems in any kind of democratic environment, such as bribery, private key selling, physically threatening, and similar. To prevent, or at least make it very hard to do so, the platform will implement a MACI (Minimum Anti-Collusion Infrastructure) solution very similar to the one found on the Ethereum ecosystem. It will be implemented in the form of another pallet which will be plugged into the main quadratic funding pallet.

### Ecosystem fit

- Are there any other projects similar to yours? If so, how is your project different?  
There is no such pallet that supports Minimal anti collusion infrastructure.

### Community engagement
We will create a blog post as a part of the milestone we submit, explaining what and how we built it.

### Future plans
As we mentioned, this is only the beginning and the first step in the process of creating a first substrate-based crowdfunding platform. After we finish with the maci-pallet, we will move to the pallet-user-registry and after that to the pallet-quadratic-funding and finally work platform (UI).

<br/>

`pallet-user-registry`  
**Preventing pseudonymous identities (Sybil resistance):**

For the platform to be credible and for funds to be matched fairly, no user should be able to fund some good more than once. It should be easy for a user to create his identity but very hard to create a pseudo-identity.

The quadratic funding pallet will be agnostic of verified user identities. Those will be plugged in the form of another pallet that implements specific interfaces.
This registry will be implemented in one of these 2 forms:
- Some collectively managed registry of whitelisted users
- Some permissionless registry that uses a 3rd party service such as **BrightID**

<br/>

`pallet-quadratic-funding`  
**Algorithm for calculating funds:**

As explained by Vitalik B. in [this](https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/12/07/quadratic.html) blog post, some voting methods will favor plutocracy while some others will neglect the range of support or disproving of creating good.
Quadratic funding seems like the best fit for aggregating people's preferences for funding some public goods, so the platform will implement the **Constrained Liberal Radicalism algorithm** (Quadratic funding) for calculating the funds for a specific project.

Bellow are all the components that have to be developed before the platform is ready for use:

_Components overview_  

| Component name | Description |  
| ------------- | ------------- |  
| Web App | The GUI used to present funding data to the users in an easy way. |  
| pallet-quadratic-funding | The pallet will contain business logic and data of the funding campaigns and be used to operate the platform. |  
| pallet-user-registry | Pallet used to manage verified users of the platform to prevent any potential Sybil attacks. |  
| pallet-maci | Minimum Anti-Collusion Infrastructure implementation for substrate-based chains  |
